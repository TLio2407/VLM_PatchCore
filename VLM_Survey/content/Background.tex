\begin{frame}{Background}
With the advent of deep learning, visual recognition research has achieved great success by leveraging end-to-end trainable deep neural networks (DNNs).
\vspace{1em}
However, the shift from traditional machine learning to deep learning comes with two new grand challenges: \begin{itemize}
        \item The slow convergence of DNN training under the classical setup of Deep Learning from scratch
        \item The laborious collection of large-scale, task specific, and crowd-labelled data in DNN training.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Recently, a new learning paradigm Pre-training, Finetuning and Prediction has demonstrated great effectiveness in a wide range of visual recognition tasks.
    \vspace{1em}
    \item Inspired by the advances in natural language processing, a new deep learning paradigm named Vision-Language Model Pre-training and Zero-shot Prediction has appeared.
\end{itemize}
